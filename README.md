# Designing-Accessible-Websites

This web pages I have designed to complete my class assignments for CISW 370 class of Sacramento City College. 

There are three pages -- Project 1, Project 2, and Final project.

I was using the WAVE evaluation tool to evaluate the pages' accessibility. 
The screen reader program was reading the pages' content in the correct order. The structure of the page is marked with the
standarts, so headings and paragraphs are read in a proper way.
