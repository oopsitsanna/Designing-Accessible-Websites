<h3>What is Web Accessibility?</h3>
<p>Web accessibility is a set of requirements, methods and technologies for developing website interfaces that make them accessible to all users. It does not matter whether a person sees well or not, walks down the street or sits in an office at the table, can use two hands or only one. Through this approach, information is available to everyone, including those with limited physical abilities due to health conditions or circumstances.<br>
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability">One billion people</a>, or about 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability. Everyone needs to have free access to the information. Everyone wants to order food from the Internet, get dressed comfortably, chat with friends and colleagues, watch a favorite TV show or read an interesting blog. But not for everyone it's that easy. This is why the accessibility approach was designed for. If the interface is available at the level of design and layout, then all users can use it on an equal footing. This is beneficial for both users and site owners.

<h3>WCAG 2.1</h3>
<p>Inside the W3C exist a working group that develops recommendations for the accessibility of a web content to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> (Accessible Rich Internet Applications). These standards define a way to make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, and help to make the clear markup for screen readers and other assistive technologies.<br><strong>The principles of WCAG 2.0 are:</strong></p>
<h4>Perceivable</h4>
<p>Perceivable website guideline describe all person's senses: sight, sound and touch. WCAG 2.0 highlight standards to make the websites accessible to people who is limited in at least one of the senses. For instance, text alternatives for images can act as short description that screen readers can read for people with vision disabilities, so it can be perceivable.</p>
<h4>Operable</h4>
<p>Making a website operable means the actions that people make while browsing the web site. This guideline helps users easily navigate or find content. For example, blind people rely on voice recognition (speech input) to interact with web content.</p>
<h4>Understandable</h4>
<p>To make website accessible also means build them as easy to use, with simple structure, readable and understandable. For instance, by identifying the language of the text content assistive technology get access  to process this text correctly.</p>
<h4>Robust</h4>
<p>Using clean HTML and CSS make a robust website. Not recommended to use scripted button or other elements for the web page, because they cannot be reached by assistive technologies. For example, to correctly process the website for the screen reader the authors may providing a name for the markup.</p>
